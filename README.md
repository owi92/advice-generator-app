## My process

### Built with

- angular
- basic html & css

### What I learned

I learned a little more about accessibility and how to implement angular's live announcer to announce the updated advice on button-press. Aria-live did not work in this project, but I could not figure out why.

### Continued development

I want to focus on and learn more about unit testing, as well as deepen my knowledge about how to create accessible websites/components.
